* Options

** Governors 
Enabling these options or disabling governors in general gives us the best
performance.
	- CONFIG_ARM_ARMADA_37XX_CPUFREQ
	- CONFIG_CPU_FREQ
	- CONFIG_CPU_FREQ_DEFAULT_GOV_PERFORMANCE

** DSA
Enabling CONFIG_NET_DSA=y will provide 3 network interfaces lan0, lan1 and wan,
as well as a master DSA interface eth0. All XDP tests must run for eth0 since 
XDP is designed to run on hardware devices.

Disabling this options will only provide an eth0 interface.
